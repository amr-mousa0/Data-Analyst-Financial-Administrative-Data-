## Ï±å The Challenge

Imagine being faced with 5 years of paper invoices, receipts, and membership logs and being asked to derive precise administrative and financial insights.

This was the core challenge: to digitize, structure, and analyze a massive volume of offline data to uncover the true financial health of the business, which was previously invisible to the management.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Process & Methodology

The project was executed in three critical phases:

### 1. Data Entry & Structuring

* Manually digitized 5 years of paper records into a structured dataset.

* Designed and implemented a robust **Star Schema** (1 Fact Table + Dimension Tables) to create a reliable single source of truth for all business metrics.

---

### 2. Data Cleaning & ETL

* Performed extensive ETL processes to clean, normalize, and validate the raw data.

* Conducted statistical analysis to identify outliers, which were confirmed as valid data points representing two distinct segments: **Regular Operations** vs. **High-Value Transactions**.

* Ensured 100% data quality and standardized formats before loading into Power BI.

---

### 3. Dashboard Design ‚Äì 3 Modules

An interactive Power BI dashboard was built, segmented into three key analytical views:

* **General Overview:** A high-level look at overall performance, KPIs, and business health.

* **Products Analysis:** A deep dive into revenue and performance of Supplements, Beverages, and Subscriptions.

* **Financial Analysis:** Focused on profitability, costs, Break-Even Point, ROI, and CAGR.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

* **Microsoft Excel:** For initial data entry, cleaning, and preparation.

* **Power BI:** For Data Modeling (Star Schema), advanced DAX calculations (KPIs), and interactive dashboard visualization.

## üìå Key Insights & Discoveries

The analysis revealed critical insights that were completely hidden within the paper records:

* **The Profitability Illusion:** The gym showed a surface-level **Profit Margin of 26%**, but this was dangerously misleading. The **Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) was -28%**, indicating the business was in a state of year-over-year decline.

---

* **Ineffective Management:** Management was focused on cutting costs (which decreased by 25% annually), yet overall losses continued to increase. This proved that the cost-cutting decisions were inefficient and harming sustainable growth.

---

* **Critical Revenue Leakage:** A total of **93,000 EGP** was identified as unrecorded or uncollected revenue due to poor billing and administrative practices.

---

* **High Customer Churn:** Over **80% of all subscriptions were monthly**, signaling a severe customer retention problem and high churn rate.

---

* **Product Performance Failure:**

    * **Supplements:** Generating a **43% net loss**, indicating a critical issue with pricing or inventory management.

    * **Beverages:** Showed only **+15% growth**, a major untapped opportunity for a high-margin, daily revenue stream.

## üí° Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following actionable recommendations were provided to management:

1.  **Immediate Re-pricing & Inventory Control** for the supplements category to stop the 43% loss.

---

2.  **Leverage Beverages** as a primary, high-margin daily profit channel.

---

3.  **Diversify Subscription Plans** (e.g., Quarterly, Annual) to improve customer retention (reduce churn).

---

4.  **Implement Strict Billing Controls** to capture the leaked revenue.

---

5.  **Shift Focus** from arbitrary cost-cutting to sustainable, profit-driven growth strategies.

‚úÖ Conclusion

This analysis highlights the critical importance of data segmentation (like separating high-value campaigns) and well-defined KPIs in marketing analytics. These practices enable clearer insights into campaign effectiveness and facilitate better-informed strategic decisions, revealing patterns often missed by surface-level observation.
