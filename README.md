From Paper to Profit: A 5-Year Financial & Administrative Analysis for a Local Gym

This project details the end-to-end data analysis of a local gym, transforming five years of paper-based records into an interactive Power BI dashboard to drive critical administrative and financial decisions.

 The Challenge

Imagine being faced with 5 years of paper invoices, receipts, and membership logs and being asked to derive precise administrative and financial insights.

This was the core challenge: to digitize, structure, and analyze a massive volume of offline data to uncover the true financial health of the business, which was previously invisible to the management.

 Process & Methodology

The project was executed in three critical phases:

1. Data Entry & Structuring

Manually digitized 5 years of paper records into a structured dataset.

Designed and implemented a robust Star Schema (1 Fact Table + Dimension Tables) to create a reliable single source of truth for all business metrics.

2. Data Cleaning & ETL

Performed extensive ETL processes to clean, normalize, and validate the raw data.

Conducted statistical analysis to identify outliers, which were confirmed as valid data points representing two distinct segments: Regular Operations vs. High-Value Transactions.

Ensured 100% data quality and standardized formats before loading into Power BI.

3. Dashboard Design â€“ 3 Modules

An interactive Power BI dashboard was built, segmented into three key analytical views:

General Overview: A high-level look at overall performance, KPIs, and business health.

Products Analysis: A deep dive into revenue and performance of Supplements, Beverages, and Subscriptions.

Financial Analysis: Focused on profitability, costs, Break-Even Point, ROI, and CAGR.

 Tools Used

Microsoft Excel: For initial data entry, cleaning, and preparation.

Power BI: For Data Modeling (Star Schema), advanced DAX calculations (KPIs), and interactive dashboard visualization.

 Key Insights & Discoveries

The analysis revealed critical insights that were completely hidden within the paper records:

The Profitability Illusion: The gym showed a surface-level Profit Margin of 26%, but this was dangerously misleading. The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) was -28%, indicating the business was in a state of year-over-year decline.

Ineffective Management: Management was focused on cutting costs (which decreased by 25% annually), yet overall losses continued to increase. This proved that the cost-cutting decisions were inefficient and harming sustainable growth.

Critical Revenue Leakage: A total of 93,000 EGP was identified as unrecorded or uncollected revenue due to poor billing and administrative practices.

High Customer Churn: Over 80% of all subscriptions were monthly, signaling a severe customer retention problem and high churn rate.

Product Performance Failure:

Supplements: Generating a 43% net loss, indicating a critical issue with pricing or inventory management.

Beverages: Showed only +15% growth, a major untapped opportunity for a high-margin, daily revenue stream.

 Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following actionable recommendations were provided to management:

Immediate Re-pricing & Inventory Control for the supplements category to stop the 43% loss.

Leverage Beverages as a primary, high-margin

âœ… Conclusion

This analysis highlights the critical importance of data segmentation (like separating high-value campaigns) and well-defined KPIs in marketing analytics. These practices enable clearer insights into campaign effectiveness and facilitate better-informed strategic decisions, revealing patterns often missed by surface-level observation.
